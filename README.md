### Bot Deathmatch Configs
This is mostly obsolete with workshop maps, but still handy to hold onto. Click
on play offline with bots, select a random map, and no bots. Load the map, then
use `changelevel some_aim_map` to change it to that map. Then type `exec dm-m4`
or dm-ak/dm-awp if you'd rather use those. I like to use the aim_ak-colt map as
it has a lot of distance.
